<p style="font-size: 18px;font-family: cursive;">Diwali is a Hindu festival that is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains all over India. It usually falls between mid-October and mid-November and lasts for five days 123. The festival is also known as the “Festival of Lights” and symbolizes the victory of good over evil and light over darkness 2.

The festival is celebrated in different ways in different parts of India, but the core value is the same – celebrating the triumph of good over evil. The festival is marked with the lighting of diyas (oil lamps) and candles, decorating homes with rangolis (colorful patterns made with colored powder), exchanging sweets and gifts, and enjoying festive delicacies</p>
