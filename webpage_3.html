<p style="font-size: 18px;font-family: cursive;">Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival that is celebrated by Hindus in honor of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and prosperity. It usually falls in August or September 123. The festival is marked with the installation of Ganeshaâ€™s clay murtis (devotional representations of a deity) privately in homes and publicly on elaborate pandals (temporary stages) 1. Observances include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts, such as prayers and vrata (fasting)</p>
